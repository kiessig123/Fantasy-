	<hr />
	<h1>The Basics</h1>
	<p>Fantasy Hold'em is a traditional poker game played with the fantasy football team that you already own.  Each week of football is in essence a game of poker, with your fantasy football team being your "Poker Hand".  As in poker there  are several rounds of action in which players can choose to "call" or "fold".  Fantasy Hold'em is a limit style poker game where all betting amounts by round are pre-determined.  Each player at the beginning of each round will be given the option to "Call" or "Fold".  As in any poker game, not all "hands" will make it to the showdown, If there is only one player to call (all other players fold) the last remaining player in the pot will win that weeks action.  If the poker hand does make it to the showdown, the best hand (highest score) will win.</p>	
	<h1>How do you play?</h1>
	<p>Fantasy Hold'em is structured with a mandatory ante and 3 rounds of optional betting. At the beginning of each week all players will be forced to "Ante-up".  This ante will be automatically deducted from each players account.  After antes have been posted, each player will have the opportunity to "Call" or "Fold" to round one action.  For players who wish to "Call" they may do so by posting "Call" on that week's league-wide smackboard.  All round one calls must be made before the first game begins on Sunday (1PM EST).  For those who wish to "Fold", no action is required as all players who have not actively called, will be folded at the end of each round.  If your "hand" is looking good after round one, or if you are feeling lucky, you may choose to call round two action.  In order to do so, you must post another "Call" on the league-wide smackboard before the late games begin Sunday afternoon (4:15 EST).  Once again, all players who have not actively called, will be folded.  After the late games on Sunday everyone in the league will have an idea as to who will win that weeks pot; if you like your chances, post another "Call" on the smackboard (round three calls are due by Monday night at 8:00 PM  EST) and await  your fate.  The weekly winner will be awarded the pot the following Wednesday morning, as soon as all stat corrections have been taken into account.</p>
	<h1>Funding</h1>
	<p>Initial funding for Fantasy Hold'em made using a portion of your league fees.  You may contribute additional funds to your Fantasy Hold'em Bankroll at any point during the season.  Simply contact your league manager after you have  made a PayPal request to send money to your fantasy league.  All deposit requests must be in by noon Thursday.  Each players Fantasy Football Bankroll will be remitted at the end of the season along with any applicable prize monies.</p>
	<h1>Why Fantasy Hold'em?</h1>
	<p>	Fantasy Hold'em is a new and exciting week by week payout system that is more fun and potentially more lucrative than other weekly payout systems commonly implemented by fantasy leagues around the country.  Fantasy Hold'em was created for League Managers who want a better way to keep their league members engaged throughout the fantasy football season.  Fantasy Hold'em is a great way to incentivize all league members to start the strongest possible fantasy team each week, regardless of record.  Bottom tier teams will undoubtedly fight for each weeks top waiver wire pick ups as they will know that, no matter how badly their team has performed to date, injuries and waiver wire stars might allow them to one day win the weekly pot, which could salvage an otherwise disastrous season.  Top Tier teams will be rewarded as they should have a decent chance to win the pot on a week by week basis.</p>
	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	<ul>
		<li><em>What if I make a call at 12:01 EST, 4:16 EST, or 8:01 EST?</em><br>All deadlines are hard deadlines.  Calls made even one minute late will not be considered. <br> <br></li>																				
		<li><em>What if I make at 10:30 am on Sunday morning then at 10:31 am I change my mind and wish to fold?</em><br>	As with any poker game, all bets are final.<br>	<br></li>																			
		<li><em>Do I really have to post "Call" on the smackboard as many as 3 times every week inorder to participate in the showdown?	</em><br>					Yes, unless you choose to "Call All-In".  You may choose to post a "Call All-In".  Any players who calls all-in will be automatically called for that weeks remaining action, giving them the opportunity to participate in that weeks showdown.  Note, All bets are final.  Once a player declares a "Call All-In" they will be called to the showdown no matter what.	<br><br></li>						
																				
		<li><em>What happens if I run out of funds during the middle of that weeks poker hand?</em>	<br>				Standard poker rules apply.  A side pot will be set up for any player who can not fully call all action made during a given hand.  Should an "All-In" player win the pot they are only entitled to funds that they were able to match themselves.  As in a traditional poker game the main pot will be awarded to the next best poker hand that had called to the showdown.</li></ul>
